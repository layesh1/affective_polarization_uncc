# Affective Polarization: Key Findings
*UNC Charlotte Fall 2025 | N = 779*

##  Main Findings

### 1. Democrats Show Higher Polarization
- Democrats: **M = 2.89** (SD = 0.78)
- Republicans: **M = 2.32** (SD = 0.62)
- **Cohen's d = 0.82** (moderate-large effect)

### 2. Social Aversion Most Asymmetric
- Democrats toward Republicans: **M = 2.32**
- Republicans toward Democrats: **M = 1.42**
- **Cohen's d = 1.04** (very large effect)

### 3. Democrats More Pro-Free Speech
- Democrats: **M = 2.67** (more supportive)
- Republicans: **M = 3.27** (neutral)
- **Cohen's d = 0.69** (moderate effect)

## Key Takeaway

**Asymmetric polarization is driven primarily by social aversion**, not moral identity or othering. Democrats are much more reluctant to befriend Republicans than vice versa.

## Reliability

- All scales show positive internal consistency (r > .40)
- Scale corrections properly applied and verified
