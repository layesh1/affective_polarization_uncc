# Affective Polarization Analysis: Executive Summary
**UNC Charlotte Student Survey - Fall 2025**  
*Analysis Date: February 05, 2026*  
*Sample Size: N = 779 (Republicans: 130, Democrats: 437, Independents: 84)*

---

## Key Findings at a Glance

### 1. **ASYMMETRIC POLARIZATION DETECTED**
Democrats exhibit significantly higher affective polarization toward Republicans than Republicans exhibit toward Democrats.

- **Democrats**: M = 2.89, SD = 0.78
- **Republicans**: M = 2.32, SD = 0.62
- **Difference**: t(562) = -7.78, p < .001, Cohen's d = 0.82

> **Interpretation**: Democrats show moderate polarization while Republicans show low-to-moderate polarization. This asymmetry suggests Democrats have stronger emotional reactions to and social distance from Republicans than vice versa.

### 2. **FREE SPEECH ATTITUDES**
Democrats are significantly more supportive of free speech rights on campus than Republicans.

- **Democrats**: M = 2.67, SD = 0.84 (lower = more supportive of freedom)
- **Republicans**: M = 3.27, SD = 0.88
- **Difference**: t(542) = 6.93, p < .001, Cohen's d = 0.69

> **Interpretation**: On a scale where 1 = support freedom and 7 = support restrictions, Democrats average 2.67 (supportive of freedom) while Republicans average 3.27 (neutral to moderately supportive of restrictions). This aligns with traditional liberal-conservative differences on free expression.

##Detailed Component Analysis

### Moral Identity (Connection Between Party & Morals)
*Scale: 1 = None at all → 5 = A great deal*

| Party | Mean | SD | Interpretation |
|-------|------|----|----|
| **Democrats** | 3.37 | 1.02 | Moderate connection |
| **Republicans** | 2.96 | 1.08 | Moderate connection |

- **Statistical Test**: t = -3.95, p = 0.0001, d = 0.39
- **Finding**: Democrats show slightly higher moral identity connection to their party affiliation.

### Othering (Perceiving Opposite Party as Different/Alien)
*Scale: 1 = None at all → 5 = A great deal*

| Party | Mean | SD | Interpretation |
|-------|------|----|----|
| **Democrats** | 2.96 | 0.97 | Moderate othering |
| **Republicans** | 2.56 | 0.93 | Moderate othering |

- **Statistical Test**: t = -4.12, p = 0.0000, d = 0.42
- **Finding**: Democrats perceive Republicans as more different/alien than Republicans perceive Democrats.

### Social Aversion (Unwillingness for Cross-Party Friendships)
*Scale: 1 = No aversion → 5 = Strong aversion*

| Party | Mean | SD | Interpretation |
|-------|------|----|----|
| **Democrats** | 2.32 | 1.06 | Low-moderate aversion |
| **Republicans** | 1.42 | 0.61 | Very low aversion |

- **Statistical Test**: t = -9.14, p < .001, d = 1.04
- **Finding**: **Most dramatic difference**. Democrats show substantially more reluctance toward cross-party friendships (M = 2.32) compared to Republicans (M = 1.42). This represents a nearly 1-point difference on a 5-point scale.

## Relationship Between Polarization and Free Speech Attitudes

### Do more polarized individuals support restricting free speech?

**Republicans**:
- Correlation: r = 0.172, p = 0.0506 (ns)
- **Finding**: No significant relationship

**Democrats**:
- Correlation: r = -0.035, p = 0.4761 (ns)
- **Finding**: No significant relationship - polarization does not predict free speech attitudes

> **Interpretation**: For Republicans, higher polarization is marginally associated with greater support for free speech (negative correlation). For Democrats, polarization and free speech attitudes are unrelated. This suggests polarization and free speech views operate independently.

## Scale Reliability & Validity

### Internal Consistency (Aversion Questions)
All aversion questions (Q135-Q140) were checked for proper scaling:

- **Republicans** (Q135, Q136, Q137-reversed): Mean inter-item r = 0.418 ✓
- **Democrats** (Q138, Q139, Q140-reversed): Mean inter-item r = 0.613 ✓

> All correlations are positive, confirming proper scale direction after reversing Q137 and Q140.

### Scale Corrections Applied
1. **Aversion Questions**: Q137 and Q140 reversed (originally asked about LIKING opposite party)
2. **Free Speech Questions**: Pro-restriction questions (Q95-Q99, Q101-Q102) reversed
3. **Trust Questions**: Pro-distrust questions (Q119-Q120, Q122) reversed

## Implications for Thesis

### Primary Contributions

1. **Asymmetric Polarization**: This study documents that Democrats show higher affective polarization than Republicans among college students at UNC Charlotte. This finding contributes to the growing literature on asymmetric polarization.

2. **Social Distance**: The large effect size for social aversion (d = 1.04) suggests Democrats maintain greater social distance from Republicans, with potential implications for cross-party dialogue and campus climate.

3. **Free Speech Context**: Democrats' greater support for free speech combined with higher polarization suggests these constructs operate independently - polarization does not necessarily predict authoritarian attitudes toward speech.

### Limitations

- **Sample**: UNC Charlotte students (N = 779) may not generalize to national population
- **Cross-Sectional**: Cannot determine causality or temporal dynamics
- **Self-Report**: Social desirability bias possible
- **Unbalanced Groups**: More Democrats (437) than Republicans (130)

### Future Directions

1. Investigate mechanisms driving asymmetric polarization
2. Examine longitudinal changes in polarization over college career
3. Test interventions to reduce social distance between groups
4. Explore role of campus climate in shaping political attitudes

## Methodological Notes

### Survey Details
- **Population**: UNC Charlotte undergraduate students enrolled in general education political science courses
- **Time Period**: Fall 2025
- **Response Rate**: Data available for 779 complete responses
- **Survey Length**: Approximately 30 minutes

### Measures

**Affective Polarization Index** (1-5 scale):
- Mean of three components: Moral Identity, Othering, and Social Aversion
- Each component measured with three items
- Higher scores indicate greater polarization

**Free Speech Restriction Index** (1-7 scale):
- Mean of 13 items (Q92-Q106) covering faculty and student speech rights
- Items include protest rights, social media, political expression
- Higher scores indicate greater support for restrictions

**Party Identification**:
- Initial question: 5-point scale from Strongly Democrat to Strongly Republican
- Follow-up for Independents: Lean Democrat vs Lean Republican
- Final categories: Democrat (including leaners), Independent (true independents), Republican (including leaners)
